    <h1>My First Pet</h1>

    <h2>Simba - The German Shepherd</h2>

    <p>Getting a dog was totally a first time for me and my family! We didn't think about which breed we should go for. Apperently we decided to have a german shepherd as we had fallen in love with simba at first sight by just seeing photos and videos. </p>

    <h3>Couldn't believe me? See him yourself</h3>

    <img src="SimbuFirstPhoto.png" alt="SimbuFirstSinglePhoto" height="500" width="320"/>
    <h4>These are his childhood pics</h4>
    <p>We still not sure which one is simba among these two because all puppies look alike! ðŸ˜‚</p>

    <p><em>With him time flew like in seconds I never thought having a dog would bring so much peace into my life and suddenly realised that he's the major part of my life.</em></p>
    <p><strong><u>But don't let this make feel you wanna get a pet cause with pet you'd be getting a responsiblity which will great period of time that takes a lot of discipline. On social media, we only see cuteness but they don't show us <mark>how hard the puppy stage is, to shape their behaviour, and many more hurdles.</u></mark> </strong></p>
    <p>Pet owners know how mischievous dogs can be <del>but no one discuss this</del> they hide it cause <em><strong> they love them</strong></em></p>
    <ins>Don't forget to follow SimbaðŸ§¡</ins>
