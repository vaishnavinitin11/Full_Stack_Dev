    <h2>Lifestyle & Culture</h2>
    <p>
      Mumbai's culture is a blend of traditional festivals, food, music, and
      theatres. The city offers a cosmopolitan and diverse lifestyle with a
      variety of food, entertainment, and night life, available in a form and
      abundance comparable to that in other world capitals. Mumbai's history as
      a major trading centre has led to a diverse range of cultures, religions,
      and cuisines coexisting in the city. This unique blend of cultures is due
      to the migration of people from all over India since the British period.

        History & Background

        <p>
          The Koli tribe, the earliest inhabitants of Mumbai, and evidence of
          human habitation for thousands of years set the stage for the city's
          historical journey. From being a center of maritime trade to becoming
          part of different dynasties and kingdoms, Mumbai experienced various
          rulers and influences. The Portuguese and British played significant
          roles in its history, with the city gradually gaining prominence as a
          commercial hub. The decline of Mughal power, the opening of trade
          routes, and the establishment of cotton mills fueled its growth.
          Mumbai faced challenges such as overcrowding, unsanitary conditions,
          and outbreaks of diseases, prompting urban development initiatives. It
          witnessed political activity during the independence movement,
          protests for state division, and sectarian riots. In the modern era,
          Mumbai faced terrorist attacks but also saw advancements in technology
          and infrastructure. While the city thrived economically, issues like
          overcrowding, pollution, and poverty persisted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mumbai continued to grow and prosper in the 21st century, in large
          part because of advances in the technology sector. By the second
          decade of the century the population of Greater Mumbai was approaching
          20 million. The cityâ€™s infrastructure was improved considerably with
          the construction of new highways and bridges, expansion of port
          facilities, and the inauguration of new public-transit systems.
          Overcrowding, traffic congestion, environmental pollution, and
          widespread poverty, however, remained major ongoing problems.

        Transportation

        <p>
          The local train system holds immense importance to the people of
          Mumbai, commonly referred to as Mumbaikars. It is the lifeline of the
          city and plays a vital role in the daily lives of its residents. The
          local train network is extensive, connecting different parts of Mumbai
          and its suburbs, and it serves as the primary mode of transportation
          for millions of commuters.
        </p>

        <p>
          The local train system in Mumbai is operated by two separate railway
          lines: the Western Line and the Central Line. It spans over hundreds
          of kilometers and has numerous stations along its routes. The trains
          are known for their crowded compartments, especially during peak
          hours, as they carry a massive volume of passengers every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mumbaikars heavily rely on local trains for their daily commute to
          work, school, and other destinations. The trains offer a
          cost-effective and relatively quick mode of transportation, especially
          when compared to the city's notorious traffic congestion. For many,
          using the local trains is not just a means of reaching their
          destinations; it has become a way of life and an integral part of the
          Mumbai experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from the local train system, Mumbai has other modes of
          transportation that contribute to its overall transportation network.
          These include:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Buses: Mumbai has an extensive bus network operated by the
            Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking. Buses
            serve various routes within the city and its suburbs, providing an
            affordable and convenient option for commuting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Metro: Mumbai's metro system, known as the Mumbai Metro, has been
            under construction in recent years. It aims to provide additional
            rapid transit options and alleviate the burden on the local trains.
            As of now, a few metro lines are operational, with more lines under
            development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Taxis and Auto-rickshaws: Taxis and auto-rickshaws are popular modes
            of transport for shorter distances and areas not easily accessible
            by trains or buses. They offer a more personalized and flexible
            transportation option, albeit at a higher cost compared to public
            transport.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ferries: Mumbai's coastal location allows for ferry services,
            particularly in areas like the iconic Gateway of India. These
            ferries connect different parts of the city and offer scenic
            transportation options, especially for travel to nearby islands.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Overall, the transportation system in Mumbai is diverse and constantly
          evolving to meet the growing needs of its population. While the local
          trains hold exceptional significance, other modes of transport
          contribute to the city's overall mobility, providing Mumbaikars with
          various options to navigate the bustling metropolis.
