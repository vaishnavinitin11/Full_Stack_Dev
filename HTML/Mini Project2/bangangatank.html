    <h1>Banganga Tank</h1>

      <p>
        The Banganga Tank is a temple tank which is part of the Hindu Walkeshwar
        Temple complex in the Malabar Hill area of the city of Mumbai, India.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The tank was built in AD 1127 by Lakshman Prabhu, a minister in the
        court of Silhara kings of Thane. It was rebuilt in 1715, funded by a
        donation from Rama Kamath. The main temple has since been reconstructed
        and is now a reinforced concrete structure of recent construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to local legend, the temple sprang forth when Rama, the exiled
        hero of the epic Ramayana, stopped at the spot in search of his
        kidnapped wife, Sita.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the legend goes, overcome with fatigue and thirst, Rama asked his
        brother Lakshmana to bring him some water. Lakshmana instantly shot an
        arrow into the ground, and water gushed forth from the ground, creating
        a tributary of the Ganges, which flows over a thousand miles away –
        hence its name, Banganga, ie the Ganga created by a baan (arrow).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Banganga also houses the Shri Kashi Math and Shri Kaivalya/Kavale
        Math of the Goud Saraswat Brahmins on its banks, including samadhis of
        the maths’ past heads.
      </p>
      <p>
        The area also has a Hindu cremation ground which after 2003 received a
        makeover to house a gas crematorium.
      </p>
      <p>
        The area still has an old Hindu cemetery consisting of samadhi shrines
        of various advaitin gurus, such as Siddharameshwar Maharaj (1888–1936)
        and his disciple, Ranjit Maharaj (1913–2000),Nisaragdatta
        Maharaj(1897-1981), Bhainath Maharaj
