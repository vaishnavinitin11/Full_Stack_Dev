        Marine Drive is a 3 kilometre-long Promenade along the Netaji Subhash
        Chandra Bose Road in Mumbai, India. The road and promenade were
        constructed by Pallonji Mistry. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete
        road along the coast of a natural bay. At the northern end of Marine
        Drive is Girgaon Chowpatty and the adjacent road along links Nariman
        Point at southern tip to Babulnath and Malabar Hill at northern tip.
        Marine Drive is situated on reclaimed land facing west-south-west.
        Marine Drive is also known as the Queen's Necklace because, when viewed
        at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street
        lights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace.

        The official name for this road, though rarely used, is Netaji Subhash
        Chandra Bose Road. The promenade is lined with palm trees. At the
        northern end of Marine Drive is Chowpatty Beach. This is a popular beach
        famed for its Bhel Puri (local fast food). Many restaurants also line
        this stretch of the road. Further down this road lies Walkeshwar, a
        wealthy neighborhood of the city, also home to the Governor of
        Maharashtra.

        Most of the buildings erected by wealthy Parsis were constructed in an
        art deco style, which was popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Among the
        earliest art deco buildings on Marine Drive were the Kapur Mahal, Zaver
        Mahal and Keval Mahal, built between 1937 and 1939 for a total cost of 1
        million rupees.

        Real estate prices along the Esplanade are high. Many hotels dot the
        drive, most prominent among them being the 5-star Oberoi (formerly the
        Oberoi Hilton Tower however reverted to the original name as of early
        2008), The Intercontinental, Hotel Marine Plaza, Sea Green Hotel and a
        few other smaller hotels. Marine Drive is the preferred connecting road
        between the central business district located at Nariman Point and the
        rest of the city.

        along the stretch of Marine Drive, including members-only clubs like the
        Cricket Club of India (CCI), adjoining the Brabourne Stadium, Hindu
        Gymkhana Ground and Garware Club House, adjacent to the famous Wankhede
        Stadium, as well as others like the Mumbai Police Gymkhana, Hindu

        A well known singer from the 1950s, Suraiya lived in a building on the
        stretch known as 'Krishna Mahal' in the ground-floor apartment (as a
        tenant of Shah family) from 1940s until her death on 31 January 2004.
        The house was first taken on rent by her mother, Mumtaz Begum. Many
        other film stars, such as Nargis and Raj Kapoor, lived nearby in the
        1940s and 50s.

        In 2012, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai announced that the
        entire road would be resurfaced, 72 years after it was originally laid.
        A number of bollards were also installed as there was nothing to prevent
        accidents or attacks. A few years earlier, the footpaths were renovated.
