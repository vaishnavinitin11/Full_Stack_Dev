            Mumbai has its own share of heritage and colonial buildings and the Asiatic Society Town Hall is one among them. Given its history and association with the British era, it becomes an important location that should not be missed by anyone visiting Mumbai.
        </p>
        <p>The Asiatic Society of Mumbai Town Hall was opened as a cultural centre for the British officials residing in Bombay. The Town Hall saw all official announcements and live performances being conducted here since its completion in 1833.</p>
        <p>
            In the present day, it houses the Asiatic Society Library, the State Central Library and a Museum, Head Office of Directorate of Libraries Maharashtra State, Additional Controller of Stamps Office, Maharashtra State Women’s Council and a Post Office.

    <h2>History of Asiatic Society Mumbai Town Hall</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            The conception of the idea of building a Town Hall was first done by the ‘Literary Society of Bombay’ with the intention of conserving literature, artefacts, cultural and oriental art. However, the society could only raise an amount of INR 10,000 through lotteries and funds which was only sufficient for completing the library and the museum. The funds raised were nowhere near to the amount required to build the entire Town Hall. Hence, the construction was put on hold until the society received funding from the government.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was only in 1833 that the construction of the Town Hall was completed.
