    <h1>Data Analytics</h1>
    <p>
      Data Analytics is a multidisciplinary field that combines statistics,
      computer science, and domain knowledge to extract insights from data. A
      typical Data Analytics course will cover topics such as data
      preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, statistical
      inference, and machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a Data Analytics course, students will learn how to work with large
      datasets and use tools such as Python or R to analyze data and create
      visualizations. They will learn how to clean and preprocess data, as well
      as perform basic statistical analysis to identify patterns and trends in
      the data. They will also learn how to use machine learning algorithms to
      build predictive models and make data-driven decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the course, students will work on real-world projects that
      require them to apply their knowledge of Data Analytics to solve business
      problems or answer research questions. They will learn how to communicate
      their findings effectively, both through written reports and
      visualizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon completing a Data Analytics course, students will have a solid
      understanding of the principles and techniques used in Data Analytics and
      be able to apply them to real-world data analysis problems. They will also
      have developed skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, and
      communication, which are valuable in a wide range of careers, including
      data science, business analytics, and marketing research.
