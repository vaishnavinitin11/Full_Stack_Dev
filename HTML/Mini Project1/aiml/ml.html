    <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
      Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on
      the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn
      from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly
      programmed. This course covers the fundamental concepts of machine
      learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, feature
      extraction, and model selection. Students will learn how to use popular
      machine learning algorithms and libraries to solve real-world problems, as
      well as evaluate the performance of their models using metrics such as
      accuracy, precision, and recall. In a Machine Learning course, students
      will typically learn the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Fundamentals of Machine Learning:
        <p>
          Students will learn the basic concepts and techniques of Machine
          Learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, overfitting,
          bias-variance tradeoff, model selection, and evaluation metrics.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
        <p>
          Students will learn how to preprocess and clean data, as well as how
          to extract and select features that are relevant to a particular task.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Supervised Learning:
        <p>
          Students will learn how to build predictive models using supervised
          learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression,
          decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Unsupervised Learning:
        <p>
          Students will learn how to cluster data and discover patterns using
          unsupervised learning algorithms such as k-means clustering,
          hierarchical clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques such
          as principal component analysis..
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Deep Learning:
        <p>
          Students will learn how to build deep neural networks using popular
          frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. They will learn how to train
          and tune neural networks for various tasks such as image
          classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Applications of Machine Learning:
        <p>
          Students will learn how to apply Machine Learning to real-world
          problems such as recommendation systems, fraud detection, image
          recognition, and natural language processing.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition to lectures and assignments, a typical Machine Learning course
      may also include hands-on programming projects, where students apply the
      concepts they learn to real-world datasets and build their own models. The
      course may also include guest lectures from industry professionals who use
      Machine Learning in their work.
