    <h1>Network Security</h1>
    <p>
      A network security course typically covers the fundamental concepts,
      principles, and techniques used to secure computer networks and systems
      from various threats and attacks. The course usually includes the
      following topics:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Network infrastructure security:
        <p>
          This topic covers the principles and techniques used to secure the
          various components of a network infrastructure, such as routers,
          switches, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Cryptography:
        <p>
          This topic covers the fundamentals of cryptography, including
          encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and key management.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Network protocols and vulnerabilities:
        <p>
          This topic covers the security vulnerabilities associated with various
          network protocols, such as TCP/IP, DNS, SMTP, and HTTP, and the
          techniques used to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Access control and authentication:
        <p>
          This topic covers the principles and techniques used to control access
          to network resources and to authenticate users and devices.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Threats and attacks:
        <p>
          This topic covers the various types of threats and attacks that can be
          launched against a network infrastructure, such as malware, viruses,
          worms, denial-of-service attacks, and social engineering attacks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Network monitoring and incident response:
        <p>
          This topic covers the principles and techniques used to monitor
          network activity for security breaches and to respond to security
          incidents.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The course may also cover additional topics, such as wireless network
      security, cloud security, and web application security, depending on the
      depth and scope of the course. The course may include lab exercises, case
      studies, and real-world examples to provide practical experience in
      implementing network security measures.
