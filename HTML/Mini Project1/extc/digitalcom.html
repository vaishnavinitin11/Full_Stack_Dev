    <h1>Digital Communication</h1>
    <p>
      Digital Communication is a course that focuses on the fundamentals of
      digital communication systems, including their design, analysis, and
      performance evaluation. The course covers a broad range of topics related
      to digital communication, such as:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Signal processing:
        <p>
          This involves the manipulation of signals in the digital domain,
          including sampling, quantization, and digital signal processing
          techniques.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Channel coding:
        <p>
          This involves the use of error-correcting codes to improve the
          reliability of communication over noisy channels.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Modulation and demodulation:
        <p>
          This involves the conversion of digital data into analog signals that
          can be transmitted over a communication channel, and the subsequent
          conversion of the received analog signals back into digital data.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiple access techniques:
        <p>
          This involves the sharing of a communication channel among multiple
          users, which is necessary for applications such as cellular networks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Digital transmission:
        <p>
          This involves the actual transmission of digital data over a
          communication channel, including the use of various modulation
          schemes, channel equalization techniques, and synchronization methods.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The course may also cover related topics such as source coding, channel
      capacity, and network protocols. Digital communication is an important
      field that has applications in many areas, including telecommunications,
      networking, and data storage.
