    <h1>Control Systems</h1>
    <p>
      Control System course is a fundamental course in the field of Electrical
      and Electronics Engineering. It covers the principles and techniques for
      analyzing, designing, and implementing control systems. The course aims to
      teach students how to design and analyze control systems that can regulate
      and stabilize physical systems, such as mechanical systems, electrical
      systems, chemical systems, and others.
