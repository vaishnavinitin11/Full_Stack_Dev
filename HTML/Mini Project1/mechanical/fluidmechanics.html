    <h1>Fluid Mechanics</h1>
    <p>
      Fluid mechanics is the study of fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) and
      their properties, including how they flow and interact with their
      surroundings. It is a fundamental course in engineering and physics that
      covers topics such as fluid statics, fluid kinematics, fluid dynamics, and
      the conservation laws that govern fluid behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluid statics deals with fluids at rest, and involves the study of
      pressure, buoyancy, and hydrostatic forces. Fluid kinematics is concerned
      with the motion of fluids without considering the forces that cause the
      motion. It includes the study of velocity fields, streamlines, and
      turbulence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluid dynamics, on the other hand, involves the study of the forces that
      cause fluids to move, such as the pressure difference between two points
      in a fluid, or the forces exerted by rotating blades in a pump. The
      conservation laws that govern fluid behavior include the conservation of
      mass, the conservation of momentum, and the conservation of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fluid mechanics has many applications in engineering, including the design
      of aircraft and spacecraft, the design of pipelines and other
      transportation systems, and the design of turbines and other energy
      conversion systems. It is also used in the design of medical devices, such
      as blood pumps and artificial hearts, and in the study of ocean currents
      and weather patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the specific topics that are typically covered in a fluid
      mechanics course include fluid properties, fluid statics, fluid
      kinematics, conservation of mass, conservation of momentum, conservation
      of energy, Bernoulli's equation, viscous flow, laminar and turbulent flow,
      dimensional analysis, and flow measurement techniques.
