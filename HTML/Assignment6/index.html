        >Hey! My name is Vaishnavi I call myself Vaish just to sound cool. I
        belong to brown family; So basically it's obvious reason of how I am. I
        don't know how to live my life to fullest or in present but this does
        not mean my life is full of tragedy I know how to balance my emotions,
        love and calm myself. This information is enough to give a gist about my
        nature!
      </em>

    <h4>
      If you ask me that vaish what you like to do or better question would be
      what action makes you happiest?
    </h4>
    <p>My answer would be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I love seeing my family happy</li>
      <li>Dogs: Whenever I see any dog I fall for them</li>
      <li>
        Last but not the least I love being me, comforting, motivating,
        forgiving me, and set my ambition to the highest.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you ask me how would you prioritise these; Then my answer would be:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>I love seeing my family happy</li>
      <li>Dogs: Whenever I see any dog I have fall for them</li>
      <li>
        Last but not the least I love being me, comforting, motivating,
        forgiving me, and set my ambition to the highest.
      </li>
    </ol>
