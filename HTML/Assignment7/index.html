    <h1>All About Placements</h1>
    <p>
      Every year thousands and thousands of students graduate with hopes of
      starting their career with a bang. However, this year due to the
      coronavirus pandemic, the campus placements closed up fast, and many
      deserving candidates didnâ€™t land any job. If you are one of those, then
      you should start your job search for the off-campus placements. Off-campus
      placements are nothing but regular jobs for freshers, and while you can
      find job openings throughout the year, a lot of them open up from May to
      August, the time when students graduate.
