    <h1>Gateway of India</h1>

      <p>
        The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century
        in the city of Mumbai (Bombay), India. It was erected to commemorate the
        landing of King-Emperor George V, the first British monarch to visit
        India, in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain.

        The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the
        Indo-Islamic style, inspired by elements of 16th-century Gujarati
        architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George
        Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in
        1924. The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26
        metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial
        arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.

        After its construction, the Gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial
        entrance to India for important colonial personnel. The Gateway is also
        the monument from where the last British troops left India in 1948,
        following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an
        angle, opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the
        Arabian Sea. Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai,
        and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a
        gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting
        services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community as it has
        been the spot for Hanukkah celebrations, with the lighting of the
        menorah, since 2003. There are five jetties located at the Gateway, of
        which two are used for commercial ferry operations.

        The Gateway was the site of a terror attack in August 2003, when there
        was a bomb blast in a taxi parked in front of it. Access to the gateway
        was restricted after people congregated at its premises following the
        2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which the Taj Hotel opposite the gateway
        and other locations in its vicinity were targeted.

        In March 2019, the Maharashtra state government proposed a four-step
        plan to develop the location for the convenience of tourists, following
        a direction issued by the state governor in February 2019.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The Gateway of India was built to commemorate the arrival of George V,
        Emperor of India and Mary of Teck, Empress consort, in India at Apollo
        Bunder, Mumbai (Bombay) on 2 December 1911 prior to the Delhi Durbar of
        1911; it was the first visit of a British monarch to India.[2][3][4]
        However, they only got to see a cardboard model of the monument,[B] as
        construction did not begin until 1915.[2][6] The foundation stone for
        the Gateway was laid on 31 March 1913 by then Governor of Bombay, Sir
        George Sydenham Clarke with the final design of George Wittet for the
        Gateway sanctioned in August 1914.[7][6] Before the Gateway's
        construction, Apollo Bunder used to serve a native fishing ground.[8]
        Between 1915 and 1919 work continued at the Apollo Bunder to reclaim the
        land on which the Gateway was to be built, along with the construction
        of a sea wall.[7] Gammon India had undertaken construction work for the
        gateway.[9][C] Its foundations were completed in 1920 while construction
        was finished in 1924.[12][7] The Gateway was opened to the public on 4
        December 1924 by then Viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of
        Reading.[13] Following Indian independence, the last British troops to
        leave India, the First Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry, passed
        through the Gateway with a 21-gun salute, as part of a ceremony on 28
        February 1948, signalling the end of the British Raj.[14][15][D]

        N. Kamala, professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University,[16] refers to the
        Gateway as a "jewel in the crown" and a "symbol of conquest and
        colonisation".[17][E] The monument commemorates the legacy of British
        colonial rule, namely the first visit of a British monarch to India and
        its use as an entry point for prominent colonial personnel into British
        India.[20] Today the Gateway is synonymous with the city of
        Mumbai.[21][22][F] Since its construction, the gateway has remained
        amongst the first structures visible to visitors arriving in Bombay by
        the sea.[25][H]
      </p>

        Since 2003, the Gateway has been the location for the local Jewish
        community to light the menorah for Hanukkah celebrations every
        year.[28][29] This ritual was started by Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg
        of the chabad in Mumbai (located in Nariman House).[28] It also became a
        site for prayers following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks which
        targeted, amongst others, Nariman House.[30] Rabbi Holtzberg lost his
        life in the 2008 terror attacks.[28]
