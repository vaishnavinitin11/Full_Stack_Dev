      <p>
        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (previously Chhatrapati Shivaji
        Terminus, Mumbai station code: CSMT (mainline)/ST (suburban), is a
        railway terminus and UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mumbai, Maharashtra,
        India.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terminus was designed by a British born architectural engineer
        Frederick William Stevens from an initial design by Axel Haig, in an
        exuberant Italian Gothic style. Its construction began in 1878, in a
        location south of the old Bori Bunder railway station, and was completed
        in 1887, the year marking 50 years of Queen Victoria's rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 1996 the station name was changed from Victoria Terminus to
        "Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus" (with station code CST) after Chhatrapati
        Shivaji Maharaj, the 17th-century warrior king who employed guerrilla
        tactics to contest the Mughal Empire and found a new state in the
        western Marathi-speaking regions of the Deccan Plateau.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017, the station was again renamed "Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
        Terminus" (with code CSMT), where the title Maharaj has literal meaning,
        "Great king; emperor." Both former initials "VT" and the current, "CST",
        are also commonly used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terminus is the headquarters of India's Central Railway. It is one
        of the busiest railway stations in India, serving as a terminal for both
        long-distance and suburban trains with a total number of 18 platforms.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Victoria Terminus</h3>
      <p>
        This famous landmark which has become a symbol of the city, was built as
        the headquarters of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway.
      </p>
      <p>
        The railway station was built to replace the Bori Bunder railway
        station, in the Bori Bunder area of Mumbai, a prominent port and
        warehouse area known for its imports and exports. Since Mumbai became a
        major port city at the time, a bigger station was built to meet its
        demands, and was named Victoria Terminus, after the then reigning
        Empress of India, Victoria. The station was designed by Frederick
        William Stevens, a British born engineer architect, attached to the
        Bombay office of the Indian colonial Public Works Department. Work began
        in 1878. He received â‚¹1,614,000 (US$20,000) as the payment for his
        services.[1] Stevens earned the commission to construct the station
        after a masterpiece watercolour sketch by draughtsman Axel Haig.[1] The
        design has been compared to George Gilbert Scott's 1873 St Pancras
        railway station in London, also in an exuberant Italian Gothic style,
        but it is far closer to[1][13] Scott's second prize winning entry for
        Berlin's parliament building, exhibited in London in 1875, which
        featured numerous towers and turrets, and a large central ribbed
        dome.[14] The style of the station is also similar to other public
        buildings of the 1870s in Mumbai, such as the Elphinstone College but
        especially the buildings of Mumbai University, also designed by G Scott.
      </p>
      <p>
        The station took ten years to complete,[13] the longest for any building
        of that era in Mumbai.
