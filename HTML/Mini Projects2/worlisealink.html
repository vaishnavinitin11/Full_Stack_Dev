      <p>
        The <strong> Bandra-Worli Sea Link </strong>(officially known as
        <strong> Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link</strong>) is a 5.6 km long, 8-lane wide
        bridge that links Bandra in the Western Suburbs of Mumbai with Worli in
        Central Mumbai. It is the longest sea bridge, as well as the 4th longest
        bridge in India after Bhupen Hazarika Setu, Dibang River Bridge and
        Mahatma Gandhi Setu. It is a cable-stayed bridge with pre-stressed
        concrete-steel viaducts on either side. It was planned as a part of the
        proposed Western Freeway that would link the Western Suburbs to Nariman
        Point in Mumbai's main business district, but is now planned to become
        part of the Coastal Road to Kandivali.
      </p>

        The 1M bridge was commissioned by the Maharashtra State Road Development
        Corporation (MSRDC), and built by the Hindustan Construction Company.
        The first four of the eight lanes of the bridge were opened to the
        public on 30 June 2009. All eight lanes were opened on 24 March 2010.

        The sea-link reduces travel time between Bandra and Worli during peak
        hours from 20 to 30 minutes to 10 minutes.[10] As of October 2009, BWSL
        had an average daily traffic of around 37,500 vehicles.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Mahim Causeway was the only road connecting the western suburbs to
        Mumbai's central business district. This north-southwestern corridor
        became a bottleneck and was highly congested at peak hours. The Western
        Freeway project was proposed to span the entire western coastline of
        Mumbai to ease congestion. The Bandra-Worli Sea Link, a bridge over
        Mahim Bay, was proposed as the first phase of this freeway system,
        offering an alternative route to the Mahim Causeway.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mujeeb Acharwala Bridge connects the intersection of the Western
        Express Highway and Swami Vivekanand Road in Bandra to the Khan Abdul
        Ghaffar Khan Road in Worli. From Worli Seaface, it connects to Mumbai's
        arterial Annie Besant Road.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project was commissioned by the Maharashtra State Road Development
        Corporation Limited (MSRDC). The contract for construction was awarded
        to the Hindustan Construction Company (HCC), with project management led
        by the UK offices of Dar Al-Handasah.

        The foundation stone was laid in 1999 by Basitt Acharwala. The original
        plan estimated the cost at ₹6.6 billion (US$83 million) to be completed
        in five years.[13] But the project was subject to numerous public
        interest litigations, with the 5-year delay resulting in the cost
        escalating to ₹16 billion (US$200 million),[14] with the additional
        interest cost alone accounting for ₹7 billion (US$88 million)
