    <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
    <p><em>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.</em></p>
    <h3>Types of Machine Learning:</h3>
    <ol type="A">
        <li><strong>Supervised Learing</strong></li>
        <p><em>Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.</em></p>
        <h4>Types of Supervised Learing algorithms are as follows: </h4>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Support-vector machines</li>
            <li>Linear regression</li>
            <li>Logistic regression</li>
            <li>Naive Bayes</li>
            <li>Linear discriminant analysis</li>
            <li>Decision trees</li>
            <li>K-nearest neighbor algorithm</li>
            <li>Neural networks (Multilayer perception)</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learing</strong></li>
        <p><em>Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.
        </em></p>
        <h4>Types of Unsupervised Learing algorithms are as follows: </h4>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>K-means Clustering</li>
            <li>KNN (K-nearest Neighnors)</li>
            <li>Hierarchical Clustering</li>
            <li>Principle Component Analysis</li>
            <li>Independent Component Analysis</li>
            <li>Apriori algorithm</li>
            <li>Singular value decomposition</li>
        </ol>
